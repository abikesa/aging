     - hearing loss risk factor for cognitive decline
     - sound-attenuated booth for quantification
     - participant wears headset:: 500-2000 Hz (normal speech)
        - $\lt 25 dB$ : no loss
        - $25-40 dB$ : mild
        - $40-60 dB$ : moderate
        - $\geq 60 dB$ : severe 
   - memory
   - arousal
